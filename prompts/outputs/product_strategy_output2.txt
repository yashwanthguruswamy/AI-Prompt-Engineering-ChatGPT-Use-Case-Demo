ðŸ“© Prompt:
Given feature A is high-impact but time-consuming, and feature B is low-impact but quick, generate a recommendation for product roadmap prioritization.

ðŸ’¬ ChatGPT Response:
While feature A offers greater long-term value, implementing feature B first allows for a quick win and immediate customer satisfaction. This approach builds momentum and buys time for the more complex feature A. I recommend rolling out B now and planning A for the next sprint.
