Prompt Title: Optimize Shift Scheduling
==========================

ðŸ“© Prompt:
You are asked to optimize shift planning for a team of 5 analysts. Write a short policy that ensures fair workload distribution.

ðŸ’¬ ChatGPT Response:
To ensure fairness, each analyst will be scheduled for an equal number of day and evening shifts across the week. No analyst will be assigned more than two back-to-back closing shifts. Shift rotations will follow a 2-week cycle to balance workload and avoid burnout.
